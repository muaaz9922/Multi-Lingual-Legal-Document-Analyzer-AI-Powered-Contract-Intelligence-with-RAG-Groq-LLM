# Multi-Lingual-Legal-Document-Analyzer-AI-Powered-Contract-Intelligence-with-RAG-Groq-LLM
An AI-driven system that analyzes, summarizes, and retrieves clauses from multilingual legal documents using RAG, FAISS, HuggingFace embeddings, and Groq LLM. Built with LangChain and rich data visualizations.

# 🏛️ Multi-Lingual Legal Document Analyzer  
### 🔍 AI-Powered Legal Intelligence using RAG, FAISS, HuggingFace & Groq LLM

---

## 🌍 Overview
This project, built by **Muaz**, is a cutting-edge **AI system that analyzes and summarizes multilingual legal documents**.  
It enables users to query contracts, extract key clauses, identify obligations, and understand complex legal terms in **plain language** — all powered by advanced **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipelines.

> 🧠 **Tech Meets Law** — turning unstructured contracts into clear, actionable intelligence.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
✅ **Multilingual Understanding** — Works with English, Arabic, Urdu, French, Spanish & more  
✅ **Clause Extraction** — Retrieves and summarizes key sections (e.g., termination, obligations)  
✅ **Plain-Language Summarization** — Converts dense legal text into easy-to-read insights  
✅ **Context-Aware Retrieval** — Uses FAISS + HuggingFace embeddings for semantic search  
✅ **LLM-Powered Reasoning** — Groq LLM provides concise and context-rich answers  
✅ **Visual Analytics Dashboard** — Entity analysis, semantic clustering, and clause networks  
✅ **Beginner-Friendly Architecture** — Modular, cell-by-cell design for easy learning

## 🧠 Technologies Used

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 💬 LLM | **Groq LLM (LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant)** | Legal question answering and summarization |
| 🧩 Framework | **LangChain** | Building the retrieval + generation pipeline |
| 🔠 Embeddings | **HuggingFace Transformers** | Multilingual sentence embeddings |
| 🧱 Vector Store | **FAISS** | Efficient document similarity search |
| 📊 Visualization | **Matplotlib, Seaborn** | Data storytelling and legal insights |
| 🧾 NLP | **spaCy** | Entity extraction and linguistic analysis |

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Document Ingestion** — Upload contracts or legal PDFs.  
2. **Text Preprocessing** — Clean, split, and embed text using multilingual transformers.  
3. **Vector Indexing** — Store embeddings in FAISS for semantic retrieval.  
4. **RAG Query Pipeline** — Retrieve relevant sections and pass them to the Groq LLM.  
5. **Answer Generation** — LLM provides concise, cited answers and plain summaries.  
6. **Visual Analytics** — Explore entities, clause networks, and language distributions.
